										<h1>I saw Sony’s next-gen RGB mini-LED TV tech in action, and OLED TVs should be worried</h1>
										<img src="img/TVs/tv01.png">
										<h2>Sony has announced a new “next-generation display system” based upon a “high density LED backlight” with individual control over the red, green and blue primary colors. The new display tech is being developed for both consumer TVs and professional displays, and will “begin mass production in 2025,” according to the company.</h2>

										<h2>While Sony’s official announcement cites 2025 as the launch date for its new RGB LED tech, the company confirmed it as a “2026 technology” at a recent demonstration I attended at its Tokyo headquarters. That confirmation means we will more realistically see it arrive in new TVs next year, or possibly in 2027.</h2>

										<h2>LCD TVs with RGB backlights aren’t exactly new – Sony developed RGB LED models as far back as 2004, and at the recent CES 2025, Samsung and TCL both had prototype mini-LED TVs with RGB backlights on display, while Hisense showed off a real RGB model it plans to release later this year.</h2>

										<h1>Sonos reportedly cancels its streaming video player, but I hope it resurrects one part of it, because it could be huge</h1>
										<img src="img/TVs/tv02.png">
										<h2>It's been known for some time that Sonos has been working on a streaming video device that was aimed to launch in 2025, with major leaks revealing what it would entail.</h2>

										<h2>Now, after Sonos' previous CEO left as a result of the company's horrible 2024, Sonos has a new CEO that's changing a lot of things within the company – and according to The Verge, this has led to the cancellation of the streaming video box launch. The Verge has proven to have very accurate Sonos information over the years, so this is almost certainly correct.</h2>

										<h2>Now, given that I called this box "doomed" based on the details we initially heard – specifically, that it would have ads-based software, yet would cost up to $400 – I can't say that I reacted with much surprise to seeing this news… but actually, I really hope this project isn't fully dead, because one half of it sounded amazing.</h2>
